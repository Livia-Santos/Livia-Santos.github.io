# My Portfolio Website #

My goal with this project is to learn and understand the potential of HTML and CSS.

It was elaborated following the guidelines exposed by the course that I am currently doing at the Coder Factory Academy.

The target audience of my site is future employers and colleagues who are also learning programming.

## Design Choices and Process ##

I wanted to show a lit bit of my personality through my website putting some pictures of my hobbies and favorite places.

For inspiration, I've used the pinterest.com to look around some good websites and color palettes.

A great Portfolio website that I run into my research was a developer called Pascal van Gemert.

I like the way he used the first image with a parallax effect and the simplicity of colors made the website look very clean.

 #### *My design guideline:* ####
I decided to go for contrasting colors using purples and a navy-ish blue. That shows a bit of my personality, romantic but also strong.

**Color:** #400035<br>
**Font:** Booklet Cordel

The font logo refers to Cordel literature, that is a popular and inexpensively printed booklet or pamphlets containing folk novels, poems, and songs.
They are produced and sold in street markets and by street vendors in Brazil, principally in the Northeast.

## Wireframes and Mockup experiences ##
My first step building this project was drawing what I was imagining for my website, which turned into my first wireframe. I was focusing only on the desktop.

Along the course, I was introduced to Figma, that made me think about all the other devices that I needed to explore. That lead to my first mockup targeting a mobile device.

The experience of doing the wireframes and mockups helped me a lot to organize my ideas and have a preview of my concept.

It wasn't a linear process since a had to go back to change my wireframes and rethink my choices throughout the project.<br>
After having my ideas organized I started to build my project in HTML and CSS.

##  Website Plan and Sections: ##

I decided to go for a single page website because I think it is easy to navigate from different devices.<br>
I also wanted to use the visual effects of parallax and the single page website was a perfect fit for that.

**Structure plans:**<br>
My website content is divided into five main parts.
The HTML syntax helped me to understand and structure the website.

Banner - HTML Div
* Main picture using transparency effects and parallax.

About - HTML Section
* A brief description about myself.

Skills - HTML Section
* A list of icons with the Languages and technologies I am learning.
* List of my favorites learning resources with links.

Work  - HTML
* A list of Apps that I built, image and a link to their code on GitHub.

Contact - Footer
* Get in touch with me through email or follow me on social medias.

Navigation Bar:<br>
Another element I used was a fixed navigation menu on the top. The fixed navigation allows the user to jump to another content at any point he wants.

## Futures Improvements: ##
This website was my first project built with HTML and CSS. I want to add more features once I have the power to that with javascript and others technologies.

- Fix the parallax on mobile versions;
- Improve Mobile interaction;
- Create a form for the desktop version;
- ...

## Tools I used: ##
* Pen and paper
* Trello Board
* Figma
* Paint 2
* Preview
* FontAwesome
