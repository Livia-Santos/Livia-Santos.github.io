# My Portfolio Website #

My goal with this project is to learn and understand the potential of HTML and CSS.

It was elaborated following the guidelines exposed by the course that I am currently doing at the Coder Factory Academy.

The target audience of my site is future employers and colleagues who are also learning programming.

## Design Choices and Process ##

I wanted to show a lit bit of my personality through my website putting some pictures of my hobbies and favorite places.

For inspiration, I've used the pinterest.com to look around some good websites and color palettes.
