# My Portfolio Website #

My goal with this project is to learn and understand the potential of HTML and CSS.

It was elaborated following the guidelines exposed by the course that I am currently doing at the Coder Factory Academy.

The target audience of my site is future employers and colleagues who are also learning programming.

## Design Choices and Process ##

I wanted to show a lit bit of my personality through my website putting some pictures of my hobbies and favorite places.

For inspiration, I've used the pinterest.com to look around some good websites and color palettes.

A great Portfolio website that I run into my research was a developer called Pascal van Gemert.

I like the way he used the first image with a parallax effect and the simplicity of colors made the website look very clean.

#### *My design guideline:* ####
<br>
I decided to go for contrasting colors using purples and a navy-ish blue. That shows a bit of my personality, romantic but also strong.
